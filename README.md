Project 3

As the bootcamp finished, I had exhausted my savings and began work again.

My job did not allow me much time to work on this project so i struggled to get what i wanted done.

My aim was to have a blog style page that allowed global users (car fanatics) to upload a photo of their car and write a little about it.

The public would then have the option to pledge a sponsor to their favourite car and driver (via stripe), i just did not get around to setting that up.

the reason behind the pledge was that when a car reached a set pledge value, they would be entered into a rally (most likely through french alps).

As i mentioned, i know personally i have not shown what I am capable of as i write this 30 minutes from deadline, but i gave it my best under the circumstances and spare time i had.
